# Computer Architecture for Programmers
Course heavily relying on materials, exercises and book from Carnegie Mellon's 15-213/18-213: "Introduction to Computer Systems"

'.md' solutions were written on hackmd.io which supports LateX (and many other neat features), so they might not render properly on Github.

Some solutions were work in progress, as I upload for archiving purposes, so they might be wrong.

## Selected topics
- data representation (IEEE754)
- low-level programming, translation of C into x86-64 assembly
- assembly rules, procedure call order, (ABI)
- linking and compilation process (ELF, .so files etc.)
- attack vulnerability (stack overflow, code injection, return-oriented programming) and how to stop them
- memory (hierarchy, locality, types of discs and their architecture, communication with the processor - interrupts etc.)
- RAM (how it's organized, replacement policy, write poicy, optimizing code for locality)
- address translation and virtual memory, TLB
- microarchitecture (jump predicting, speculation, Out-of-Order processors)
- assembly x86-64, C and gdb skills
- interesting labs
